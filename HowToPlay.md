## Plot
You are an adventurous 10-year old kid--represented by an `a` in-game--exploring a world full of little creatures, called Poketes.

Throughout your journey, you will encounter wild Poketes and other Pokete trainers seeking a battle. Catch wild Poketes and use them in battle to help you conquer trainers and catch different types of wild Poketes. Level up your Poketes by using them in battle and try to catch them all!

## Controls

Once engaged by a wild Pokete, you may:

`1` Attack the Pokete until it is weak enough to catch with a [Poketeball](#poketeballs).

`2` Run away.

`3` Open your [Inventory](#inventory) to select an item.

`4` Open your deck to select a different Pokete.

To attack, press `1`. A little window with your available attacks will pop up. Press the number next to your desired attack to execute said attack. Otherwise, you may use `W` and `S` to navigate to your desired attack. Then, click `enter`. 

The number displayed next to an attack represents its AP--or Attack Points. AP refers to the number of uses you have remaining for each attack. Keep an eye on your AP and select your attacks wisely!

## Trainers
The Pokete world is full of trainers just like you! They are NPCs--non-playable characters-- represented by an `a` on the map. Trainers love nothing more than to battle their Poketes and test themselves against other trainers. Prepare for an inescapable battle if you step too close!

## Trading
There is an NPC trader in [Pokete centers](#pokete-centers) that you can trade Poketes with. Talk to them and start trading!
If you're in the same network as another Pokete-player, you can also trade one of your Poketes for one of theirs. 

![trading](assets/ss/ss21.png)

When trading with another player in your network, keep in mind that one player is the host and the other is the guest. The host must be the one to start the trade.

![trading](assets/ss/ss22.png)

When prompted, the guest must type in the hostname of the host's computer displayed on the host's display.  

_Note: You may run into problems with firewalls._

## Shiny Poketes
Shiny Poketes are rare (1/500 chance) and much stronger than regular wild Poketes. Shiny Poketes have an additional 2 points of attack, defense, and initiative. They also 5 HP more than regular wild Poketes. Shiny Poketes' names are highlighted yellow. Keep an eye out for these rare Poketes and do your best to catch them!

## Pokete-dex
Press `5` to access your Pokete-dex.

The Pokete dex displays all of the different Poketes you've captured as well as the stats of each Pokete type. Poketes you failed to catch or are yet to encounter are represented by "???".

## Learning Attacks
Level up your Poketes to learn new attacks! Every fifth level, a Pokete will try to learn a new attack. 

![learning](assets/ss/ss26.png)

If your Pokete already knows four attacks, you must choose to replace an existing attack with the new attack or discard the new attack. If your Pokete does not yet know four attacks, the new attack will be automatically learned.

## Learning-Discs
LDs--or Learning Discs--can be used to teach a Pokete a special attack. Explore the Pokete world to find hidden LDs scattered throughout the map! 

_Note: LDs may only be applied once! Think carefully before applying an LD to one of your Poketes._
